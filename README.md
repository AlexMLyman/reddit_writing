Tools for the analysis of the Writing Prompts subreddit

In order to use these tools, you will need to obtain a key to reddit's API which can be done at: https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API

The reddit_scraper and comment_getter will get you some data. Tools for analysis are forthcoming.

You can use the prompt_getter and prompt_generator to generate your own prompts. They are found in the prompt_bot file, and can have some very fun results.
